# Airsoft Vapen
Project OverView:

What are the major features of your web application? 
To allow the user to input their own custom airsoft build into the website. 

Problem to solve? 
To show off custom airsoft guilds and place to allow the user to see builds people have done and where to buy the parts, get first-hand user info from players. 


What libraries or frameworks will be used? None right now, FrameWork will be Django Framework


As a user, I want to be able to add a picture of my airsoft gun and what part i have install and give info about what i have done to it.  I want to be able to find other usersâ€™ builds and put them on a favorites list and rate them and post a comment to ask about the build. I want a link to where they bought the parts and gun.
